# Programming Assignments of CSE 486/586

### Overview

The goal of these assignments is to develop the skills of designing and implementing distributed protocols over multiple machines. 
They are more about designing and understanding the protocols/systems rather than programming.

Assignment 1 is a simple application of MapReduce. It familiarizes you with the Go language and the distributed coding environment. 

Assignment 2 works on a more complicated protocolâ€”distributed snapshot. It expects you to tackle more challenging designs. 

Assignment 3 and 4 implement Raft, a complex consensus protocol. It expects you to solve difficult problems in distributed systems.


### System and Language Requirement

* You can develop your code on any OS, e.g., MacOS, Windows, Linux. Please note that TAs will grade your assignments on Ubuntu. 
* The assignments are written in Go. The tests are known to work with Go v1.13 and above. 
* Git is required for assignment submission.
